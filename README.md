# reapkgs-extras

Nix flake generated using [reapkgs](https://github.com/silvarc141/reapkgs) for an arbitrary list of [ReaPack](https://reapack.com) repos, that are not in the "known" list (already [here](https://github.com/silvarc141/reapkgs-known)).  

If you want an index url to be included, add it to repos.txt and make a PR.

Since regeneration is automated, the flake provides no vetting of packages.
